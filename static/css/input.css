/*
This directive injects Tailwind's base styles into your CSS. These base 
styles include modern-normalize to ensure browsers render all elements 
more consistently and in line with modern standards. It's the foundational 
layer that includes styles for standard elements like body, h1, h2, p, 
etc., setting them up for a more consistent design across different 
browsers.

This directive imports Tailwind's component classes into your stylesheet. 
Components in Tailwind are predefined classes that apply a more complex 
set of styles to elements, potentially composed of multiple utility 
classes. For example, a button component might combine padding, background 
color, text color, and border-radius utilities into a single reusable class.

/*
this directive brings in Tailwind's utility classes, which are the core of 
the framework. These utilities cover a wide range of CSS properties, 
allowing for detailed styling directly in your HTML markup. They include 
margins, padding, text colors, background colors, flexbox utilities, and 
more, enabling a utility-first approach to styling.
