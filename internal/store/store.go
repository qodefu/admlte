// Package store is designed to define data structures and interfaces for storing and retrieving data.
// In this context, it focuses on user-related data operations.

// User struct defines the structure for user information within the application.
// It includes basic attributes like email and password.
type User struct {
	Email    string // Email attribute to uniquely identify the user.
	Password string // Password attribute for authentication purposes.
}

// UserStore interface declares the operations that can be performed on user data.
// This abstraction allows for different implementations of user data storage,
// such as in-memory stores, database-backed stores, or even external services.
type UserStore interface {
	// CreateUser is a method to add a new user with the given email and password.
	// It should return an error if the user cannot be created, for example, if a user with the same email already exists.
	CreateUser(email string, password string) error

	// GetUser is a method to retrieve a user by their email.
	// It returns a pointer to a User struct and an error.
	// The error should be non-nil if the user cannot be found or if there's another issue retrieving the user.
	GetUser(email string) (*User, error)
