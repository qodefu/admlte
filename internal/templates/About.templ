/*
How It Works
    Write Templ Files: Developers write .templ files to define the structure of various HTML 
	components or pages in their application, using a mix of HTML markup and Templ syntax for 
	dynamic content.

    Compile with Templ: The .templ files are compiled using the Templ toolchain. This process 
	generates Go source files that contain functions to produce the HTML content defined in the 
	Templ files.

    Use in Go Application: In your Go application, you import the generated package 
	(in this case, templates) and call the functions (such as About()) to render HTML pages. 
	These functions can be integrated with your web server's request handlers to dynamically 
	generate responses for web requests.

Benefits

    Type Safety and Compile-Time Checks: Because the final output is Go code, you benefit from 
	Go's type safety and compile-time checks, reducing runtime errors in your web application.

    Reusability and Modularity: Templ encourages the creation of reusable components, making it 
	easier to manage and update your application's UI.

    Close Integration with Go: Templ's design complements Go's approach to web development, 
	allowing for a seamless development experience that leverages Go's strengths in handling web 
	requests and generating dynamic content.

This .templ file example illustrates the foundational concept of using Templ for defining static 
HTML content within a dynamic web application context.
