// Define a 'NotFound' template that generates the HTML content for a 404 Not Found page.
// This template takes no parameters, indicating it renders a static content structure.
templ NotFound() {
    // The main content of the template is an <h1> element displaying a 404 error code.
    // This simple structure is typically used as a placeholder or minimal response
    // to indicate to users that the requested resource could not be found.
    <h1>404</h1>
}

Key Concepts:
    Simplicity: The NotFound template is straightforward, reflecting the common practice of keeping error pages like 404 Not Found simple and to the point. This helps avoid further confusing users who have encountered a broken link or mistyped a URL.
    User Experience: Even though the template is simple, it serves an important role in user experience. A clear 404 page can help guide users back to the main site or to working pages. Although not demonstrated in this basic template, typically, 404 pages might include links back to the homepage, a search box, or suggestions for finding the desired content.
    Extensibility: While this template is minimalistic, Templ's integration with Go allows for easily expanding the error page to include more dynamic content, such as suggested pages, or to log 404 errors for analysis by developers. Templ's functionality makes it straightforward to pass in data and render it as needed.
    Integration with Web Applications: In a web application using Templ, this NotFound template could be rendered in response to HTTP requests that do not match any defined routes or for which the requested resources do not exist. This integration helps maintain a consistent look and feel across your application, even in error scenarios.

This NotFound.templ file is a basic example of using Templ to manage application views, specifically for handling HTTP 404 errors in a user-friendly manner.
